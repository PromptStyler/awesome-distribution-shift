A curated list of papers and resources about the distribution shift in machine learning. I categorize them based on their topic and content. I will try to make this list updated.

An example of distribution shift in images across domains from [DomainBed](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DomainBed).

### Domain Adaptation


### Test-time Adaptation

## Modality
Above papers study the distribution shift on images. There are also many applications to other data modalities.
### Applications to Language

### Applications to Graph

### Applications to Time Series

### Applications to Tabular Data

### Applications to Video/Speech

## Decentralized

Besides generalization, detection, fairness and robustness are also studied.
## Detection

## Fairness

## Robustness
